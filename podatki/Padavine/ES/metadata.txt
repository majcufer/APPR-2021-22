236,TORTOSA - OBSERVATORIO DEL EBRO,SPAIN,+40:49:14,+000:29:29,44 m 
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Land use:
On slight terrace bordered on S and W by Ebro valley. Ebro River is ~2km away. Station sits on field in front of small building (49m away). WNW: a hill of 3ft height. Wind sensors are placed on metal tower over building to 10m above ground level.
* Soil type:

* Surface coverage:
Grass
* History:
The Observatory was established in 1905 by the Jesuit congregation. It is placed on a little hill, at 50 m above the sea level. No great location changes has been detected since then. <br> Until 1982 this observatory used a different method than the current for calculating the precipitation intensity, so there are very large rainfall intensities. Previously calculated with the tangent to the curve and is now calculated with the secant. <br> For most of the period, cloud cover was expressed originaly as tenths of covered sky. <br> Wind speed obtained as average total run of wind, from 07h to 07h through a mechanical counter (Robinson cup anemometer).

237,VALENCIA,SPAIN,+39:28:50,-000:21:59,11 m 
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Land use:
In October 1937 the observatory was moved to the  Valencia Municipal Nurseries, in a gardened and flat area. Until the 1960s the observatory was in a garden practically on the outskirts of the city. Gradually the city grew and now the observatory is close
* Soil type:

* Surface coverage:

* History:
After the 1960s a 12-story building 30 meters east of the observatory is build. From the 1970s the Nurseries  were extended on the west side of Observatory, with large trees that influence wind gusts from the west, which often leads to lower maximum wind gusts measurements. <br> From 1942 and until the late 1980s (exact date not determined), the meteorological shelter was placed on grass. In the late 1980s grass was removed and the shelter was on natural terrain. On 17/01/2006, because of the redesigning of the Centre the grass was re-setting.<br>
Between 1942 and April 30, 1975 a full anemocinemógrafo Fuess was working at the observatory, it was on a metal tower on the terrace, to 19.7 m from the ground. <br>
It was changed by a FUESS anemometer on April, 30, 1975. <br>
On January, 1, 1983 a SEAC automatic station replaces the Fuess, it was installed on a new tower located in the same place, to 26.6 m above the ground. <br>

Between 1944 (?) and 1970 sensors were installed in the old tower of the airport technical block.<br> In 1971 sensors are placed into a hut next to the runway, near where the aeronautical equipment is at the 30 runway header. <br> In 1975, sensors were moved to the current observatory at the 30 runway header. <br> Because of a sensor calibration error, temperature between January 2006 and July 2008 had a negative bias between 1.5 and 2.0&#176;C. <br> On September 16, 2010 the thermometer has been moved from the cage at the wind tower, and it is placed within an anti-radiation cage. <br> Around May 1971, the barometer and the rest of the instrumentation are uninstalled from a tower (20-30m?) and placed at  the runway walk.

* History:
The observations started in April 1997. Previously there was another tp station with the call sign 1111 located in the same place where the de Santander CMT is now placed. Meteorological observations were made between 1911 and 1962, but in the database the data are only recorded between 1946 and 1962 and their quality remain to be analyzed. <br> The precipitation series is valid, but we have to take into account that precipitation is significantly lower than in nearby towns due to the situation of the observatory. <br>
From October 16, 2007, the wind sensors were placed at a height of 10 meters above the ground, next to the meteorological garden. The wind sensors between 13/11/2003 and 16/10/2007 were located at a height of about 21 meters above the ground. It is estimated that for this location the anemometer values are overestimated by about 10% compared with those that would measured to the height of 10 meters recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).<br>

* History:
The observations started in 1953. They were not made between August 1975 and September 1977 due to repairs at the airport. From September 1977 data are taken from meteorological garden located near the passenger terminal. In March 2006, began taking data with a SIMAS automatic station located in the runway header 11, approximately 700 meters from the old meteorological garden. <br>
The precipitation series is only valid from 1978. <br>
The temperature series is only valid from 1961. <br>
Confirmed the minimum temperature of -5.4&#176;C day 21/Jan/1957. <br>
In September 1991, the anemometer which was located in the control tower to 39 meters high was placed in the runway header 29 to 10 meters high. Since March 2006 the wind data are obtained from an anemometer at the header 11, to 10 meters high.
